Hi all! I’m mathematician/statician who likes to code and enjoy nature.

- 👀 My PhD research is in _Scientific Machine Learning_, fancy name for the best of mathematics and artificial intelligence.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on research from different fields and I would love to volunteer at non-profit organizations.
